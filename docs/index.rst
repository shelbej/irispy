IRISPy is a SunPy-affiliated package that provides the tools to read in and
analyze data from the `IRIS <http://iris.lmsal.com>`__ solar-observing
satellite in Python.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph is a NASA-funded Small Explorer which
uses a high-frame-rate ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to make observations of
the Sun. It provides 0.3 arcsec angular resolution and sub-angstrom spectral
resolution.

For more information see the mission/instrument paper which is available
